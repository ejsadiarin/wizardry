#  Ship forward US Laptops (cheaper) to PH

Ref: https://www.reddit.com/r/Tech_Philippines/s/djyVnBxTrE
It’s just 1299$ = Php 75,000 in B&H Photo US website. Then you can ship to PH via ship forwarder, like Kango for around 5K with insurance.

I suppose like any store, you could ship it back to them for an x guaranteed days/month for manufacturing defects, which I haven't experienced shipping back to them yet.

I only tried buying MacBooks thrice—in 2018, 2023, and 2024. The first two were mine (MacBook Pro Version 2016 & MacBook M1 Max) while the third is for my friend's (M4 Pro). All of which didn't have any problem assuming all have a 1-Year Apple Warranty like all of its regular devices.

There are many ship forwarders from US to Philippines, and only one of them is Kango Express. They are like couriers that receives a delivered item for you with their address as if it’s your address (so if you don’t have a US address, you put theirs). Then they send that item to you—“ship forwarding”.

Other examples are Shipping Cart, Johnny Air. But I found Kango Express to be the cheapest now so far.
