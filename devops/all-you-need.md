# All you need to learn/adopt DevOps
1. Everything should be centered around **automation** and **Git** (version control)
  - Understand Git *deeply*
2. Write everything you're making in **code** with Git for version control
  - use Ansible and IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
  - even simple scripts - its how to start to train yourself
3. Adopt a **developer workflow** (e.g. Agile, Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
4. Understand Software Architecture
5. Read documentation and write documentation
  - When solving a problem, your first instinct should be is:
    - **to google (search/ask ai)** 
    - **READ** the docs

# Common tools you need
- [ ] 1. **Kubernetes** (see [learning-kubernetes]())
  - **Managed** (EKS, AKS, GKE, OpenShift)
  - **Self-managed**
  - Essential tools for Kubernetes (e.g. Helm, Kustomize, ArgoCD or FluxCD, etc.)
- [ ] 2. **Docker (Containers)**
- [ ] 3. **Terraform (IaC)**
- [ ] 4. **Ansible (Automation & Configuration Management)**
- [ ] 5. **CI/CD tools (any tool mentioned below)**
  - GitHub Actions
  - GitLab CI
  - Azure DevOps
  - Jenkins
- [ ] 6. **Monitoring tools (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)**
- [ ] 7. **Cloud provider (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)** - pick one
- [ ] 8. **Programming language (e.g. Python, Go, etc.)** - pick one

# Remember these 3 things
1. **Failure is optimal.**
  - Failure is accepted and built into the process. 
  - Practice accepting your own failures, quickly, and move on.
2. **The ability to learn and adapt is the biggest trait required for DevOps.**
  - Accept that Technology is ever-evolving and rapidly changing
3. Slow is steady, steady is fast. 
  - take your time and write good code. Its okay to write good code that fails. Ugly hard to read code that fails is significantly worse.
