# Pre-learning Phase (Preparation/Planning)
- **Planning:** research order of topics (roadmap) and method of learning
  1. What to learn? (Subject)
    - e.g. learning a language
    - e.g. learning DevOps  
  2. Order to learn? (Roadmap)
    - e.g. follow a roadmap (self-made or guided) or a course
  3. How to learn? (Roadmap)
    - identify vital things to learn on that subject
      - e.g. grammar rules, basic words, then phrases (in order)
      - e.g. identify what tools to use and identify what problems to does DevOps solve
    - then identify the most efficient way to learn them
      - e.g. speaking to people (natives)
- **Set aside 10% of your time for planning (pre-learning):** to avoid procrastination
  - e.g. the exam is in 10 days, spend 1 day planning the roadmap

# Learning Phase
**Focus on these 3 things:**
1. Focusing - focused learning is the key to effective learning
  - do whatever it takes to be in the state of **being focused** 
  - e.g. no distractions, meditation, pomodoro, etc.
2. Practicing - make your environment as close to the real thing as possible
  - e.g. for language learning, speak to natives
  - e.g. for DevOps, use the tools to spin up a production environment and solve problems in that way (can be in homelab or cloud)
3. Drilling - target weaknesses and practice them
  - make drills as close to the goal context as possible (again)
  - e.g. for DevOps, practice solving real-world problems in a production environment
