# Backups and Vulnerability Management

I do the following:

1. Cloudflare proxy in front of server which allows me to block IP based on geo-location data, only countries where I expect users to access are allowed.
2. Nginx reverse proxy to only need to open basic ports like 443 and enable auto ssl redirection. It also adds some basic security features that come out the box like strict https as well as auto renewing ssl certs using Let's Encrypt.
3. Datadog for monitoring and telemetry routed to pagerduty to call my phone on anomalous activity or outages. Also helps create pretty dashboards.
4. Watchtower scheduled to pull latest images on patch Tuesdays for auto updating of my application containers.
5. Regular OS and security patches.
6. Crashplan cloud backups and hardware raid redundancy for data protection.
7. VPN tunnel for some services.
8. I've used Oragnizrr in the past for making private services accessible on public internet without needing to be on a  network with a IGW.
9. SSH keys, limit admin accounts, permissions management. Don't run apps as root.
10. I'd really like to forward all application audit logs with tagging to datadog but that is expensive so I skipped it.

- scan periodically
- Add fail2ban or crowdsec
- Tenable
