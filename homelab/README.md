## Stages of Homelabbing

> There are three stages of homelabbing you will find on this subreddit.
**Stage 1** - the beginning: you have a all in one router from your ISP or maybe you bought a gaming router because it looks cool and promises so and so feature, maybe a switch and a pihole running on a rpi3. You call this your homelab and you are proud of it, which you should be, because this is the first step into this rabbit hole.
**Stage 2** - growing spiral: while your beginners homelab runs just fine and you maybe even integrated a fileshare with an external HDD into your rpi, you are finding better and better offerings for used enterprise hardware on the Internet. And one day, you find that sweet r720 that's just to good of an offer to not take it. But what now? Of course you need a rack now and this rack has so much more space and you always wanted to add several WAPs to your housing and... And... And...
**Stage 3** - adjusting hardware to your needs: last years power bill might have been a bit to much and the partner acceptance factor dropped heavily due to the costs and the noise your lab produces. Or you had to move and simply don't have the room for your rack anymore. That's when most start downsizing to usff PCs. Maybe one tower server for virtualization or as a multi bay NAS. Or they go ham, like the one user I've seen recently on this sub, who bought a 20 ft shipping container to put his lab in.
Regardless of how big or small your lab is, if you are setting up services at home, trying to improve them, break things and have to tell your partner (and kids) that the Internet may be down for the next two hours, you are homelabbing.
