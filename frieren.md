# Frieren: Beyond Journey's End
- my Favorite anime of all time


# What Frieren Taught Me
- You have the option to be happy. Why choose to be less happy?
- The greatest achievement in life is the influence and impact you made on other people
- The journey is hard, yes. But make the journey, a silly journey. So when you look back, you can say that it is a journey worth remembering.
- One moment can impact a person's life forever.
- Time is the most valuable and most available resource for everyone, yet so limited and so short at the same time. Make
  every moment count.
- You create your ideal future by focusing on the present.
- People think too much.
- Simple is best.
- It is best to be silly and happy while finding the joy of what happens in the present moment than to be overly serious
  and pedantic about what happens in the future.
- The best foking approach in life is to plan your goal and expect for the worse to anticipate failures (so you don't get
wiped out when you experience a failure). Plan dynamically with the same goal in mind. It doesn't matter how you get
there as long as you get there regardless. THEN make your journey towards that goal as silly and as fun as possible,
enjoying the hardships of life with your companions along the way.
- Sometimes, the things considered by many as "impractical" are the most practical ones.
- Himmel gigachad, be like Himmel.
