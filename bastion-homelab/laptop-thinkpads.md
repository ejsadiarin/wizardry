# Choose the right ThinkPad laptop for IT
**What is the best laptop for college in an IS/IT/Cybersecurity Track ?**

Let's ignore makes & models and identify requirements first:

- You want an enterprise-class, or business-class product and NOT a consumer-product.

- Consumer products are designed to sit on a desk and not move for the majority of their life-expectancy.
- Enterprise products are designed to be moved and used every single day by people who earn their living using the device.

- You want a CPU that is fully supported by Windows 11 that offers at least 4 threads.

- Anything less than 4 threads is going to represent a performance concern for a lot of software titles.
- There needs to be hardware TPM on the motherboard to appease Windows 11.
- You want at least 16GB of RAM.
- This is a sweet spot in price / performance.

- More RAM is always nice. But don't buy a 64GB monster laptop just because you can afford it.
- 16GB, 24GB, 32GB are all perfectly fine and valid configurations.
- You want at least 1TB of internal, primary storage, and it needs to be an NVMe SSD.

- Your primary Windows install will probably be happy with 256-512GB of space allocated to it.
- MS-Office (M365) will go on the Windows install, along with software tools for various projects.

- You're going to want at least one Linux VM or a dual-boot partition. That's 64 to 128GB for light to moderate tinkering, and 256GB for more focused usage.

- You will be well-served with a 1080p display. Spending more on 2K or 4K is not necessary.
- Any screen size from 13" to 15.6" is fine.
- I find the 14" form-factor to be ideal.
- 17" and 19" gaming monsters are discouraged - but you do you.

**Reminder: business/enterprise class laptops can be easily opened up using a small torx screwdriver so you can upgrade the RAM, SSD and replace the battery yourself.**

*So, buying a model with a 512GB SSD by default, and adding a 4TB monster later is a valid purchasing decision.*

### Lenovo ThinkPad
- I acknowledge that Dell Latitude and XPS are perfectly valid devices.
- I further acknowledge that HP EliteBook is also a valid product.
*But I like ThinkPads.*
*Not ThinkBook. Not IdealPad. Those are trash.*

**Recommended ThinkPad series:**
1. **The ThinkPad T-series** is the mainstream workhorse issued to thousands of working professionals all over the place.
2. **The ThinkPad X-series** is the slightly lighter and thinner version for those who prioritize lightweight mobility over performance.
3. **The ThinkPad P-series** is the heavyweight workstation replacement for those who need horsepower and are prepared to carry a heavier device to get it.

**Other (not recommended) ThinkPad series:**
- The ThinkPad L-series is a value or budget focused device that I don't recommend, but others may have more positive experiences with.
- The ThinkPad E-series are the same as the L-series. Too many cost-cutting decisions.
- The ThinkPad Yoga family are usually laptop/tablet convertibles that I also do not recommend.

Here is a perfectly valid device for under $500:

The Lenovo Refurbished Outlet is here:

Go to `ebay` or `r/thinkpadsforsale` & look for a used T480, T490, or T14.

Look for one with an i5 or i7, 16+GB RAM, and make sure it has a FHD screen. Cost should be ~$300-500.
