  > The novelty of doing new stuff really wears off when you're maintaining and ultimately on the hook for every flavour of AWS serverless configuration or ECS.
    I try to bring order to the chaos, you need a really good reason to deviate from the patterns.
    - AWS Lambda/SQS/SNS/S3/DynamoDB type services.
    - ECS Fargate fire and forget stateless containerised workloads.
    - EKS... though that's a post in itself how you start standardising on top of that.
  > I second the patterns part. Keep a few things that keep the core workloads going and simple. If anything needs to deviate, it will also have a solid reasoning behind it. If there isn’t one, don’t deviate.
  > 100%. I think the general philosophies of *checks notes* platform engineering is a good summation of this. It boils down to:
    - Enable developer self-service via standardization AND canned solutions
    - if there's a need to deviate, they can either:
      - build a strong enough case to add it to the formally supported IDP or:
      - they can support it themselves
    The universal goal of virtually every business, no matter your methodology cult or religion of choice, is to make money without costing money. Sometimes unnecessary complexity costs too much money, sometimes it can make enough to justify it.
  > Add a little terraform and some Helm standards and you got a winner everyone
  > Yes. S3 Bucket serving static website behind cloud front and route 53 dns. Then api on alb serving a few k8s services with nothing fancy. We're contractors so this is extremely monotonous to me. All pipelines are the same to me. Getting creative usually means the customer is going to be a headache and we're about to build some rube Goldberg nonsense.
  > Considering automating? Automating should be part of the architecture process, design and create repeatable blueprints, whether it be python cdk or terraform.. or whatever. base line everything.
  > Dockerfile setup -> Github actions CI/CD setup -> write YAML K8s files -> push to cluster & set up ingress rules in nginx if needed public access

All the actual devops work is getting the secrets and configs right.

Edit: one thing to mention about contracting. Telling each customer about the same thing requires wildly different approaches. People are weird.

  > Welcome to DecSecOps.
    Dev to build the thing and test it Sec to ensure things are safe Ops to ensure they keep working and can be deployed
    - When creating anything on AWS or any cloud or PasS, you either need to document every single step and decision made, or to deploy and manage it using Infrastructure as Code. That way if something goes wrong or it needs to be duplicated it can be.
     When writing code, use defensive programming and ensure the inputs are valid before doing anything else with those inputs. Write tests for your code, make sure you test the unhappy path for the error cases
    - Security is an aspect that needs to be implemented from the ground up as part of your code.
    - Use a least privilege approach so that things only have the minimum permission needed for them to function. This will involve writing IAM policies and assigning them to various custom roles.
    - Encryption in flight. Serve all your content via a TLS connection, if you are calling other APIs connect to them via a TLS connection such as HTTPS.
    - Encryption at rest. Store the content in your S3 bucket encrypted using either the default encryption key or a CMK via KMS
    - Along with least privilege comes the concept of minimizing the blast radius, where if someone gets access to something they shouldn't, they can't go anywhere else.
    - Apply industry best practice and keep them up to date as things change over time.
    - Use versioning of objects in your S3 buckets, that way you can see if anyone has screwed with a file in the bucket.
    - Configure auditing and logging of access, you want to see who accessed what and when and what they did.
    - Use a WAF in front of your exposed interfaces
    - The above covers you for roughly all the things that are internal to AWS.
    - When exposing your API, you will need some system of authentication to ensure only authorized users or systems can access them. We don't know enough about your clients/users to answer here. But in general you want to use some form of OAuth2, SAML, or API key driven approach probably using JWTs for authentication.
    - Finally you want observability into things, metrics, logs, and traces. See where errors are there are, how long things take, who and what is happening. For this the four golden signals (as per the Google SRE book) probably utilizing either or both the RED or USE methods for metrics.
    - And all of that still doesn't cover the CI/CD aspect of your application.
    - Being a developer is so much easier than having to deal with the ever evolving world of Cloud tech, Ops, and Security, that is part of the life of the DevSecOps people.
    - Tutorials don't cover half of this stuff, some of it is just learning and playing around, and things that work now might not work tomorrow. I am revisiting some IaC for an S3 bucket that was created 7+ months ago, that same IaC doesn't work anymore. APIs and things have changed.
    - Good luck.

  - long textbook: https://csc-knu.github.io/sys-prog/books/Andrew%20S.%20Tanenbaum%20-%20Computer%20Networks.pdf
  >  I would start by getting a firm understanding on topics like DNS, IP addresses, Subnets, Ports and what each can be used for. I would also look into methods like netrace to to understand how packets of information move across networks. Networks is great answer, but you need to start much more granular and spread out. Good solid base with these things and you are golden.
11. DevOps from developer's perspective tasks to do:

> As a java devops who is responsible for teaching junior devs I can probably apply:
    1. Web security, OWASP top 10
    2. Network protocols. - ip, tcp, dns, http - important headers (etag, if, cache-control, cookie..) and response codes classes, tls (+ crypto), websockets.
    3. Docker - dockerfiles, repositories, cli, compose. Dockerize petstore app and run locally in docker.
    4. Set up nginx in a docker as a reverse proxy in front of a petstore.
    5. REST and principles: HATEOAS, idempotence, cacheability.
    6. SQL databases - how to deploy locally with docker, analyze and optimize queries (explain), indices, data types. Deploy database locally in docker.
