- see how to [install Revanced Manager]()

- download APKs from APKMirror (tap on the Revanced Patcher Section -> "Suggested:..." button)
- download and use [AntiSplit M]() from GitHub to merge split APKs (bundle) into one APK

1. Download suggested APK version from APKMirror or any **TRUSTED SOURCE**
   - after downloading, DO NOT OPEN and INSTALL YET!
2. Select from Storage -> select downloaded APK
3. Patch -> Wait -> Install

then boom Open! You now have a better quality experience on the APP
