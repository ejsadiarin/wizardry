# WIZARDY
- the legendary collection of technology, wield the power of the thing closest to magic.

## The Legendary Collection - Directories Explanation
- `scripts-magic-spells` - contains scripts or "magic spells"
- `bastion-homelab` - contains notes related to setting up the perfect homelab 
  - also contains `CLI` tools necessary for homelabbing (e.g. `docker`, `kubernetes`, `tailscale`, `aws-cli`, `ansible`, `terraform`, etc.)
- `useful-cli-tools` - contains CLI tools for everyday use

## Scripts - Magic Spells
- all custom scripts are prefixed with `,`
- this has tremendous benefits:
  1. `,` autocompletion on custom scripts
  2. distinguishable own custom scripts
  3. prevents name conflicts (script collisions on custom vs system)
  4. can have a script with the same name as a system command (e.g. `,ls`)

## Programming
- any language works
- I recommend Go (simple, fast as fok, and powerful) and Python (the swiss army knife, slow for large projects)
  - both are perfect for scripts alongside bash (use bash for scripts)
