# using LLMs for generating specific project ideas based on own skillset
I believe people are using LLMs a lot nowadays. 

A small suggestion: 
- Ask a few LLMs this question:
- **< Hey, I have this skillset x,y,z could you suggest some unique project ideas.**
<br>1. *Ideas must be unique with a usable value to the community,*
<br>2. *You must provide a basic understanding of how to implement each of those projects with pseudocode using my skillset,*
<br>3. *how to package and deploy the final project**
<br>4. *I want you to order the project ideas from simple to complex and you must provide the estimated implementation time of each project>*

That usually does the trick.

You will gain more insight on how your simple projects has a big impact. Next step is - do not directly put the project name in your resume/cv, Use the fancy real world value added project. Again, take help from LLMs.

Hope this helps.

### More details on: **`Do not directly put the project in your resume/cv. Use the fancy real world value added project`**
> Certain. Let me put an example here:
> 
> There is a project - which downloads some csv file from a certain website (the website already contains the download links), and uses those data to plot a graph. And based on the graph/chart visual representation, sends some email to someone or a group of people. This project is dead simple. Can even be done in 100 lines.
> 
> What I usually do is, I find out what data I am going to use. I am using Publicly available Govt Datasets some of which are updated daily. Pulling them via API/downloading them via some scraper. Clean it up and show it to my front end or expose to my API. Or sometimes both.
> 
> Let’s say, the dataset is blood bank data. Where are the blood banks. Combine them with Google Maps. And you get an App where you can search for nearest blood bank.
> 
> Ultimately your project title becomes “Is there a blood bank nearby?”.
> 
> You can enrich this later on.
> 
> See how a very simple idea sounds like something useful and good to humanity?
