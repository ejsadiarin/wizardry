# Social Engineering

### When interviewing for a company
- Ask them THIS one question:
  - **If you were to hire me today, in what part of the company would I be the most impactful in?**
  - Reason: this frames the recruiter that you're already in the company and not just a candidate.
  - Counter (worst outcome): recruiter will say "If I'm going to hire you, then we'll know".
