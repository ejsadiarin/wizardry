# CPU
- *IMPORTANT NOTE: the CPU and GPU should be similar in performance to prevent bottlenecks* 
- see BUILDS section for best CPU-GPU combos
- the GENERATION is more important than the model
  - an i3 from the latest gen is a lot better than an i9 from 5 years ago

## Intel CPU Details
### Model
*higher model = higher cache capacity = better ofc*
- i3 - entry-level
- i5 - performance-focused, gaming
- i7 - heavy tasks, can stream and game at same time, video editing
- intel ultra series - efficiency with performance (new)
- i9 - best, most powerful, have atleast 12 cores

## "TDP Values" (Postfixes)
- K, X, XE --> CPU is unlocked (supports overclocking)
- HK, HX --> overclocking-enabled CPUs for laptops
- no letter --> locked CPU
- H --> locked CPUs for laptops 
  - ex. laptops with high-res, high refresh rate models (varies by region, see display info)
- F --> doesn't support overclocking and not capable of video output
  - needs to buy seperate GPU
- KF --> support overclocking but don't have integrate GPU
- T, U --> optimized for lighter tasks
  - have integrated GPUs but not able to reach higher clock speeds
  - optimzed for longer battery life

## AMD CPU Details
- Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7, Ryzen 9
- all AMD CPUs suport overclocking
- x3D line - best

## High-end
- Ryzen 7 7800x3D (the GOAT)
  - am5 CPU
- Ryzen 7 5800x3D
- Ryzen 7 5700
- i9 14900K
- i7 14700KF
## Mid-range
- Ryzen 5 7600X
  - am5 CPU
  - can be comboed with rtx 4060 super
## Budget
- Ryzen 5 7500F
  - am5 CPU
  - $120-$130
- Ryzen 5 5600x
  - 5600g only supports PCIE Gen 3, has integrated GPU
- Ryzen 5500

# GPU
- *IMPORTANT NOTE: the CPU and GPU should be similar in performance to prevent bottlenecks* 
- AMD: any RX
  -  
- NVIDIA: any GTX, RTX
  - has CUDA cores best for Ray Tracing, animations, training AI models, etc.

## High-end
- RTX 4070 super (works with any am5 CPUs)
- 4060
## Mid-range
## Budget
- AMD RX6600
- AMD RX6650xt
- AMD RX7700xt

# RAM
- see QVL list of Motherboard first (for compatibility)
## Recommended
- 16GB
- 32GB (RECOMMENDED)
- DDR4-3200 
  - DDR4 range is 3600MHz-4000MHz (2666MHz for most casual use)
- DDR5-4800, DDR5-6000MHz 
  - range is 4800 above


# Motherboard
- see if have WiFi support
- support overclocking

## Recommended
- any B550M (Gigabyte B550M DS3H AC, MSI B550M Pro-VDH WiFi)
- any B450M

## Budget
- 450 or 550 (any AM4)

# Storage (SSD)
- any M.2 SSD

- Lexar
- Samsung

# Power Supply (PSU)
- should not go below 450w (650w is RECOMMENDED)

## Recommended
- XPG Pylon Series (650 Bronze, etc.)

# Case
